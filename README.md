# OctoBlank v1.2

OctoBlank is a chatbot AI developed in Python using the GPT4All library. It features a persistent memory system that can be fully customized and managed by the user. The AI operates via a sleek Pygame interface that provides a simple, modern user experience.

## Features
- **Memory System**: 
  - Save and load conversation history in a JSON file (`dtb.json`).
  - Use `/deldtb` to delete all stored memory.
  - Use `/costumdeldtb` to delete specific entries from the memory.
- **Pygame Interface**: 
  - Chat design with a text input field and a "Send" button.
  - Interaction for sending messages and viewing responses.
- **AI Details**:
  - AI Name: **OctoBlank**
  - Version: **v1.2**
  - Built with Python and JSON-based memory storage.

## How to install?
1. Install the files and put them into a folder
2. Install the python requirements - for python 3.13.2 (64-bit)
3. Open main.py file in VS Code and run the file

## Details
1. The dtb.json file can affect the AI responses so keep the dtb.json file clear if you want better responses (or train the AI in the dtb.json file for better responses)
2. After you pressed the button `Send` it will take a few seconds for the AI to answer
3. This project was done using DeepSeek and ChatGPT (ChatGPT did the icon app - if you wanna convert the project into an app you will also have the app icon; Deepseek did the main functionalities)
